# How to Communicate With a Raspberry Pi over WLAN Using a Web Interface
In this repository I setup a web based connection between my computer and my Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W with the goal of devleoping a starting point for more complicated projects in the future. While I will use a specific hardware setup and tech stack in this tutorial the methods will be quite general and apply to almost any tech/hardware stack. The main things to take away from this tutorial will be the system architecture, headless pi implementation, and a few of the GPIO libraries used.
